## What is ACross?

`ACross` is a simple and modern GUI client for `v2ray`, written in `Qt6` & `QML`. It is one of the main projects of the `Arktoria` community.

Focus on user experience, simplicity and practicality are our principles. Thus, we do not provide many redundant functions but design a few flexible ones to optimize users' experience. To keep the project pure and clean, there's no build-in core, but you can easily set the core and even customize the interface.

### Supported Platforms

- Linux
- Windows (at least Windows 10 or newer)

### Supported Protocols

- VMESS
- Trojan
- Shadowsocks

### Subscription Formats

- SIP008
- Base64 (`ss://` | `vmess://` | `trojan://`)

We also provide manual local configuration management and automatic update.

The information of the nodes are stored in an `SQLite3` database, which allows queries and backup outside this app.
